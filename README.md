This challenge was a beast. Please run the movie_lib.py file to see what I have. It's returning an error when trying to load in a module I was trying to use to get a percentile of a data set, to determine which movies are in the top 5%. I didn't get to the point where a user interface is really needed, since I can't compare the data sets to make recommendations. You can see some prompts in the methods in the Movie class which I intended to integrate into the larger product. There are also some notes where I've included code that I was assisted with my others in the class, or code I found online, which works but I'm not always certain why.
