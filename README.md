#What to Watch

This repository is for the What to Watch assignment at the Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

This assignment was a longer weekend assignment. The purpose was to access the data in the data files (included in the repository) which consisted of user information, ratings, and movie information for a database of movie ratings from the 1990s/early 2000s, and to write a program which would provide movie recommendations to other users based upon their prior ratings. This assignment was our first forray into data science, without the knowledge of such data organization programs as Pandas. It was also a chance to really dig into using classes and object-oriented programming.

The program is not complete, and now that I am aware of the advantages of using Pandas, I may not complete it; this assignment could be done in minutes using pandas instead.
